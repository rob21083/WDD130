The first page of my website will be entitled Bio. The Bio will be a page consisting of personal information about me, where I live, hobbies I like to participate in, why I would be a good fit for potential work force or employer. The page will have an image of me another image of something I like. It will be creatively styled and geared toward displaying a good face. This will be the main page when you go to the web site and will have a navigation bar at the top with two other pages you can go see. The text for the bio will read something like this:

I love coding, its a way to be creative and share unique ways to excite the mind. I got started into coding recently and am anxious to continue growing my skills and developing better ways to code.
